⚙️ Installation & Setup

1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/Vineela-16/Civil-Engineering-Insight-Studio.git
cd Civil-Engineering-Insight-Studio

2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows

3️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

4️⃣ Configure API Key

Create a .env file in the project root and add:

GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash


🔑 Get your API key from: https://ai.google.dev/

⚠️ Note: The .env file is not included in the repository for security reasons.

▶️ Running the Application
streamlit run app.py


The application will open in your browser at:

http://localhost:8501

🧪 How to Use

Upload an image (JPG / JPEG / PNG) of a civil engineering structure

(Optional) Add additional context or questions

Click “Describe Structure”

View the generated professional engineering report

⚠️ Limitations

Analysis is based only on visual input

Dimensions and materials are approximate

Results should be validated by qualified professionals for real-world use
